## JPA C.R.U.D. Project - Stock Analysis Tool

### Overview:

This program is designed to a be website application that creates, reads, updates and deletes stocks via database using Java Database Connectivity.

### How to run:

First, the user enters the index page. The user can choose to:
1. Search the list of stocks via stock ticker in order to inquire on different metrics which would be impactful in making meaningful investment decisions.
2. The user is able to add a stock which may not previously be in the database due to pinkslip, OTC status or due to new or potential IPO / DPO listings.
3. The user is able to display a list of all stocks on file making viewing total metrics or inquiring on overall stock metrics and trends possible.
4. (delete implementation was left out due to the ill effect of user's being able to remove stocks from the database).

The website application will then start the search process of the database and return the result of the search with all of the list data.

### Technologies used:

JavaScript, Java, Java Persistence API, JPQL, Spring MVC & STS, Gradle, SQL, MySQL Workbench, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Apache, Tomcat, AWS, Atom, Git, and Github.

### Topics implemented:

Javascript was used in order to load resize , tune scroll functionality along with enhance css padding.

Dynamic Web Applications using Spring MVC.

Tomcat8 on AWS EC2 Instance.

JSP Standard Tag Library to generate HTML.

CSS and Bootstrap to make it web and mobile-friendly.

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

Relational Databases: SQL Database creation using MySQL Workbench.

Java Libraries: SQL, List, and handling exceptions.

Object-Oriented Programming in Java: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

Test Driven Development using JUNIT Juniper.

### Lessons learned:

This project helped me better grasp the capabilities of Dynamic Web Applications by allowing me to better learn how to:
1. Build a database using MySQL Workbench.
2. Understand Spring Application Contexts.
3. Use the Java Persistence API to generate HTML.
4. Build a Dynamic Web Applications using Spring MVC.
5. Enhanced ease of ability in interacting with the database via JPQL.
